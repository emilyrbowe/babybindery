His life’s work is built around it. In 2009 he gave a talk in front of a small audience entitled A Universe from Nothing that’s now accumulated over 2 million views. The popularity of this video spurred Krauss to write a book of the same name which Richard Dawkins has called the most important scientific book since Darwin’s On the Origin of Species.
A Universe from Nothing explores how the universe as we know it arose from at type of bizarre ‘quantum nothingness’ and in the wake of the book’s success Krauss has rapidly become a poster-child for a new type of cosmology, setting off a war of words with the religious and philosophical establishment. He’s even making his mark on pop culture, from being retweeted by Miley Cyrus to appearing in Werner Herzog’s latest film Salt and Fire. With his increased notoriety it seems that Krauss is extending his influence in all directions, and right now this might be the best thing that could happen to science.

There’s a lot of exciting things going on in the world of physics right now. Gravitational waves potentially being detected for the first time and the brightest supernova ever detected ASASSN-151h was also recently found. Could you elaborate on those findings and how much excitement it’s generating?
Yeah, it could be an incredible year if all goes well. The LIGO apparatus in Washington and Louisiana, which is the biggest gravitational wave interferometer in the world, is looking for gravitational waves from the most cataclysmic astrophysical events around. It has been upgraded to the point where it should be sensitive to such events in our galaxy or galaxies that aren’t too far away and there have been rumors that maybe they’ve already seen something. So the community is very excited about it. If indeed they have found something then it will open up a totally new window on the universe because gravitational waves will allow us to see literally to the edge of black holes and understand and explore gravity in incredibly strong regimes where we haven’t been able to see it before. I think it will become the astronomy of the 21st Century.

At the same time there’s another important thing happening. The Large Hadron Collider has been turned on again and has also been upgraded. As you know it discovered the Higgs particle a few years ago but now we’re looking beyond the Higgs to try and understand why forces have the nature that they do and why particles have the masses that they do. Recently there was evidence from the Large Hadron Collider of a new totally unexpected elementary particle. If it really is true (and at this point we don’t know) then it will force us to change a lot of ideas about where we’re going in particle physics. That result may not prove to be accurate but there could easily be a result like it in the next year or so.

And as you said the most powerful supernova ever discovered was seen, it was about six hundred billion times the brightness of our sun. So every time we use our new telescopes we find new and amazing things. The universe is a big place and an old place where strange and rare events happen all the time.

You work within many different areas. You’re a professional advocate for science and reason, a cosmologist, a public intellectual, a physicist, director of the Origins Project at Arizona State University studying many different kinds of origins of life in the universe. Does that about cover it?
I’m also chairman of the board at the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists which is trying and has tried since 1945 to alert the public to the dangers of nuclear war and other existential threats that we need to take care of. We run the Doomsday Clock which represents a countdown to potential global catastrophe. Every year we unveil the new time of the clock. Earlier this week it was set for 2016 at three minutes to midnight. I think it’s an incredibly important thing to alert people to the dangers of nuclear war and climate change. So that’s something else I do that’s important to me.

My life is different every day because I have a lot of hats. Usually it’s hectic. I’m also doing work today for the Origins Project which looks at everything from the origins of the universe to the origins of consciousness and beyond.  I’m a very busy man, in principle at least. But I’m basically pretty lazy so if didn’t fill up my time with lots of things I think I might not do anything.
