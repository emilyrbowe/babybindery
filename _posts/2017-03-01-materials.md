* Brown Design Workshop
* Wednesday, March 15, 2017, 5-7pm


The shape of letters is dependent on tools and materials. Materials aren involved in two ways: the material used to inscribe letterforms, and the material into which the letters are inscribed. Letters are made by something and exist on something (or in it). The history of typography shadows the history of printing presses and papermaking. But given the boon in digital fabrication options, letterforms themselves are finding new shapes. Whether on plastic, styrofoam, wood, vinyl, metal or made by hand, letters can look like almost anything if you let them.

RISD Associate Professor in Graphic Design John Caserta will show digital and physical examples of typography made with various tools and materials. Attendees should bring their laptops in order to fabricate their own  typography in the Brown Design Workshop. Some materials will be on hand, but attendees are encouraged to bring their own.
