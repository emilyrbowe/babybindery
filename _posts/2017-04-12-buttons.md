### The prompt
 Members were emailed and asked to design a button in less than two days. The prompt was the following&#58; “A button is seen up close and on your person (or bag). How can you engage another human? How do you show you’re part of ‘a tribe’?” Designs range from left-leaning political commentary to visual aphorisms and typographic pleasantries. Project was part of the AIGA RI SeeUs exhibition, spring 2017.

The machine is currently site at New Harvest Coffee in downtown Providence.
