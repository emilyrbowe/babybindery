While the webpage structures are mutable to your needs, the print.html and print_twocol.html layouts are special.

In each layout, a fixed number of pages are generated (you can change this number by editing `_config.yml`. Thereâ€™s a lot of nesting to keep track of details, and this is the list from outside in: `.sheet`, `.page`, `.content-wrapper`, then either one or two `.page-content` (based on one- or two-column layout), then `.content` divs that have content flowed into them. 

All of the content comes from `book.html` or `book_twocol.html`.
