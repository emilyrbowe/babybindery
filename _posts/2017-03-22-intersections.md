What does collaboration look like? Having run The Design Office — a collaborative of designers — for 10 years, I have been keeping a list of ways that designers can work together — since the term gets thrown around as something that is either easy to achieve or necessary.  

I’d like to stage photographic sequences for each of the collaborative models. Probably would take place in an abstracted white room setting… but perhaps also at The Design Office big table. Images would be inspired by 1970s matter-of-fact how-to imagery … but using contemporary tools and dress.
