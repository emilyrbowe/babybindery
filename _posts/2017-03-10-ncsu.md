>> the world of technics itself must be tranformed: salvation lies, not in the pragmatic adaptation of the human personality to the machine, but in the readaptation of the machine, itself a product of life's needs for order and organization, to the human personality. --- page 14 of Art & Technics


The early 20th century critic Lewis Mumford gave a series of lectures in the early 1950s about Art & Technics. The criticism remains prescient, even if the specifics change. I would like you to read the chapter (lecture) from the volume that looks at the history of printing as a way to understand mechanization's relationship to handwork. It is called From Handicraft to Machine Art and starts on [page 59 of this pdf](https://monoskop.org/images/e/e8/Mumford_Lewis_Art_and_Technics.pdf). The chapter, I believe, is appropriate for graphic designers today, who find themselves buoyed a technical layer above printing. The 21st century designer must broker the needs of the machine (or the system of machines). But under what value system? That of the machine (efficiency, predictability, etc) or of the person (in an idealized state, perhaps).

When in Venice, California recently, I feasted on the latest works of great architects. But the most common new construction was dystopic, which can be described as **UX Modernism** — highly predictable, quickly produced and made as hip as the materials and machines allow it to be. I discovered that many of the homes were made by leaders of the tech sector nearby in **Silicon Beach**.

Is the history of Graphic Design no one of the history of machines -- a profession defined by its departure from manual lettering?

During my visit to your class, I would like to show you how I've attempted to hold onto humanist values in my own work. Following this, I'd like to discuss how Mumford's lecture applies to your work in school and beyond (if it does). Where do human values play into design? How do they come in conflict with the values of machines — and, now, automation.
