LTWP: Hello! Alright, great. uhh it is march 1st in providence, rhode island and my name is Lukas winklerprins and we’re here in Market House and I am interviewing 

HS: Hannah Subotnik

LTWP: thank you, and thanks for agreeing to do this. so, uhh, i guess the first question is: What do you identify as, at this point in your life?

HS: Mmmm, a girl, [laughs], I guess an artist, although I’m not sure. I know I want to be an artist. I want to be someone who is an active thinker, someone who is excited by things and the world. 

OK

Yeah

And I know too that you’re a student right now.

I am a student right now, Uhm, I’m in my fifth year of the brown-rise dual degree program. 

but that’s an important distinction in terms of what you identify as, what you present as! and so you see your artist hood as before your student hood? 

uhh I think at this point in my fifth year, yes. Uhh it feels almost like before this I would have said I was a student, and now I think I’m finally starting to grasp on to some general things I’m interested in, some concepts, techniques, and genres that I feel more comfortable saying I’m an artist. 

and those things are… can you nail them down? You’re working in film right now.

Yeah, I study Film/Animation/Video at RISD and I study Modern Culture and Media at Brown. And I think some of the things that i’ve been interested in, and continue to be interested in, have been dance, cuz i danced for much of my life

do you still dance?

on occasion. it is still important to me. Dance… reinterpreting my idea of dance, dance on film, experimental film, and, uhh, themes of attachment and intimacy are a lot of the themes that I usually touch on. 

Mmm

And have for a while, intentionally and unintentionally

And those come out in all the forms you’re playing with?

Usually, Yeah, the subject matters I’m drawn to when I’m making my own work, It’s about personal life and these themes 

And so one of my key goals of these interviews is learning more about processes from idea to fruition in how people are working, have you found particular modes that work for taking those ideas and your experiences—a lot of what we talk about when we hang out is about interpersonal relationships—and how do you take those thoughts and turn them into a piece? Is there, a way that you do that or is it different every time? 

I think, it’s kinda cheating to say, but fI do work pretty intuitively. What I normally do when I’m working is I usually do work for assignments at this point. My degree project is technically an assignment, it’s making  film, a lot of what I do for those is kind of… I think maybe the starting point of my work is usually observation. Just in the world. And often I just find I’m drawn to things like, kind of on the darker side usually. Things that come to my mind, or visual imagery in the world. 

OK

I’m better at looking than thinking, I think. Visual imagery in the world, sparks some thought. It could be very abstract. It could be two objects next to each other that I’m touching, or some kind of floating… rain, rivers, the street, stuff like that, generates certain feelings in mine that usually spurs on certain thoughts and then I usually end up taking a lot of photographs. Of anything. On my phone and also sometimes on my SLR. And I do work digitally because… I like how film looks but I don’t like how film costs. After that I, in-between taking photographs, photographs usually overlaps with starting to make things move. And then I often will do research on photographers that I like. That’s a soupy mixture, and my usual working mode is to generate a lot of material and only use some of it.

OK

I usually generate a ton of material and then shake it down, very finely. 

Yeah

I will have generated often hours of footage and then end up with a 2-minute film. To me, that’s the way I usually work. That’s the way I worked freshman year, too, even when I wasn’t working in film, I would just make a ton of photographs, or like make a ton of prints, 

Do you feel like that mode—I mean, if you were working that way already freshman year do you think it emerged out of high school or foundations year?

I think some of it was, like, me just being excited, me being nervous that I had to get enough material so I’d have something good to show. Some of it’s just, it takes a lot of pressure off, for me, and I really like to experiment. So experimentation, material experimentation, idea experimentation, that’s really important to me. I never think of an idea and then execute it, or very rarely, I usually am thinking a bit while I’m working on it, which means I have to work alone a lot of the time, because, or else 

Because it’s still—as you said—a soupy mix?

Yeah, and I can’t really explain what I am doing all the time, it gets explained visually usually. While I’m working.

Yeah. That’s really cool. I am thinking, now, of this series of images, of David Lynch, talking about film. And the interviewer’s like “tell us what your new film’s about!” And he’s like “no!!! no, go see the film. the film is the talking. Me talking about it doesn’t do anything. I talked by making it. So go watch it.” 

I don’t know if I’m the same, negative view on talking about things, but I definitely have a lot of trouble with it, so, ideally I’d like to get to a point where i could explain. But usually that comes much after the thing is done. I can sit back and think “oh, that’s what I did! that’s what that was about! I made that because of this!” and usually that comes much later.

Yeah

When people ask me what I’m working on right now it’s not that I don’t want to tell them, it’s just I have a lot of trouble telling them. 

Uhh, that’s really cool. When I think of you, movement is crucial to what I identify as what you’re interested in and what you create. What is movement, to you?

That’s a hard question… I think 

Do you think there’s a reason you’ve gravitated towards it? A reason you are attracted to movement? 

I was always attracted to it in terms of emotional expression. that was my main draw to dance. I could express myself emotionally, it was an emotional outlet . It was much more intuitive to me than using words, or even thinking about dance in terms of shapes and forms, and that didn’t quite got to the heart of it for me. For me dance was always about some sort of emotional outlet. And expressing how I felt without being explicit about it. I’ve always experienced things very physically. Feelings… not in my brain, I feel in my stomach and my body. I’ve had to learn how to know what I’m feeling. 

Or how to turn that into brain-language?

Yeah, even for me, I’ve had to learn to interpret my body signs to understand that I’m sad. Or that I’m stressed. So I think that was … some sort of emotional representation is what movement is to me. Right now. Although I am also interested in exploring the dance narrative a bit. Which is a different exploration. Very different than emotion-laden.

But what about reading—can it be read as emotional?

Probably. I’m not necessarily interested in dramatic movement, but often strong, subtle movement that says something small and subtle that you have to interpret. I think that’s why dance on the screen fascinates me, because you don’t have to be theatrical about it. You can be small and project it really large. 

Would you rather see a well-edited video of a performed dance, or the dance live? From like a fixed seat?

If it was made for theater, then I’d see it in a theater. But if it was made for film, then I’d see it there. I’m personally interested in dance that can only exist on film. Where cuts and editing and camera angles are as much a part of the dance as the movement. 

That’s so rich! Really cool. OK, another thing I’m interested in, with this project, is peoples’ responding to Providence. But you are unique in that you are from here!

I am from here.

So what… let me unpack this question a bit… well, what is Providence to you? 

It’s my home! It’s where I grew up. But it’s also neither of my parents are from here.

Where are they from?

They’re both kind of from a lot of places. But my dad’s kinda from San Francisco and New York… and LA… and my Mom is from New England as a whole. And sort of DC also. They both moved a lot. But they moved here to teach at RISD a couple years before I was born. So I’ve always been here but they haven’t so I don’t feel strong familial ties to Providence, which is kind of nice because, it’s the kind of place where… I do want to add, I love Providence, I love its history in particular, and its darkness… at night… Providence has this darkness you get reminded of at night. A lot of my shotgun memories of Providence are walking at night and there being candles in windows, and lanterns… that has really influenced my work. And I think being near the ocean is important to me, and it’s much darker ocean than, like, California blue ocean. Although California’s ocean is probably more dangerous. But I think the history in particular…

There’s a lot of old here, a lot of spooky, in a haunted sense. 

I was never scared, I’m always interested. I get scared by a lot of things but that doesn’t scare me. 

Do you want to leave Providence?

Yes, I do… I think I would like to go to a bunch of different places, but I think it’s time for me to leave. Maybe I’ll come back some day. But it’d have to be far in the future. I’ve been here for all 23 years of my life and I think it’s time to move somewhere else. I do think it’s home to me. 

And that somewhere else—do you think you’ll move because you get a job, or you’ll get a job wherever you move?

I think I’ll move because I get a job or an opportunity, at this point. Like a grant. I think a lot of what I love is what I would do, actively, and when I go to grad school it will make sense to settle down in a place, so I think where I move next will be because of an opportunity. 

What of your work do you want to fuel that opportunity? What of your work would you want to be paid to do? 

Maybe taking photographs, right now, actually? I would love to get paid to take photographs, or, I mean, to make films? Although I really want to own my own work and that is really hard. The other thing is teaching, I would like to get paid to teach. I don’t want to say that’s part of my work but it’s something I’m interested in. I think that being in academia, in the long term, would be really fulfilling to me because I would be able to make my own work, but I would also be around new things all the time, and I would maybe be able to make a different to a couple people

So there’s a sense of ownership there too, that might not be tied to… as in, there’s some work you want to be able to do but not worry about getting paid for.

Yeah. A lot of the work I make, I want to own it. [laughs] I don’t want a studio to own it. I’m happy to work on things with people for other people, but I’ve always had trouble commercializing my work. Not that I’m a “purist” or anything, and I know I’ll have to change to make money… I don’t have a trust fund. I would ideally like to not have what I feel is *my* work be what’s making my money. I wouldn’t mind working for somebody else. 

So you said you think academia in the long term could be fulfilling to you? Teaching  the kind son things you’ve studied? 

I think teaching some sort of photography or experimental film or something performance-related, yeah! That would be my ideal. I don’t know where. 

Well, these interviews are very biased by what I”m interested in… and I’m really interested in what effective pedagogy looks like. Especially in the arts. And if you were the head of… a department, what department would that be? And what would you hope that experience is for the students? 

It would be some sort of media-based department but not digital media? Basically a film animation video department, probably. Or maybe a photography one. I think that, my mother is a very good… and my father, they’re good templates for what I feel is effective pedagogy. And I think they’re very open-minded, that’s extremely important for teachers to be. I think they want to learn as much as they want to teach. And I think they both approach teaching very seriously. Like they work really hard and take it very seriously, but also they don’t make it so serious that it loses it’s fun. They let students be what they be. There’s no right and wrong—which sounds kind of stupid to say, because, or very obvious, but I’ve heard so many people say “this is the way you do this, and don’t do it like this”. Even on occasion here, at Brown/RISD, it’s like, I don’t want to be told how to do something! [laughs] and I think a lot of the fun of school for me is figuring out new ways to do something. That’s really important. 

And… you’re imagining a student would come out with an understanding, being able to make their own ways to do things. 

That’s my personal bias too. I’m not used to filtering into the industry. So if you’re interested in filtering into the industry, there are schools for that. That’s not the one I would like to head. I think that’s totally fine, there’s nothing wrong with that, it’s just not what I’m interested in. I think, like a good teacher provides an atmosphere through a combination of complicated things. And then can watch the students grow by themselves. And be supportive. I think that really is important, it’s almost an antiquated view right now

Like supportive professionally? mentoring?

It’s really important, the more supported you are, the more willing you are to branch out. 

That’s a beautiful metaphor.

Thank you! I didn’t mean to say it like that and then after I said it, it was a metaphor! [laughs]

Nice, yeah. We can wrap up. Last question. What advice would you give to someone in your shoes? 

Someone in my shoes…? meaning… my age? 

Someone… in your… position of age and institutional context and culture, how about. 

Ummm… Continue to be excited. I think discipline is really important, actually, I think ballet instilled that in me. Ballet and my mom. But I do think discipline has gotten me pretty far on the path I wanted to go down. So discipline, thinking discipline, is really important. Discipline that’s directed by your personal thoughts. And not by anything exterior. That’s where I’d love to be all the time!

Yeah!

And I’m definitely not an angel in that aspect, but um, I do think that is important to me. And not caring about what other people think is important. And relaxing. Allowing things to happen for you, sometimes, because you can’t plan everything. 

True. 

Listen to your mom!
