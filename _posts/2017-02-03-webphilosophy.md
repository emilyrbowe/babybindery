Towards a web teaching philosophy

How do you teach someone to design for the web? Is the web that different than other screen-based formats (phone/tablet apps, pdfs, software).

The design process relies on fiddling, adjusting, coming across by intention or accident something that stops the maker. There is a pause, some sort of analysis, an adjustment. If this is limited to the 2D space, then there is more design left to be done by someone else. Michaelson quote about playing with an engine as it’s running. There needs to be enough code knowledge to play with interactive designs. Maybe not construct from scratch, but to hack it.

Humanist approach. The notion of usability as a long timeline. Sometimes usability is the sole goal. But there can be many goals. Pleasure.

Good interaction design can be built upon good print design. It can be learned in parallel to. But ‘classic’ skills such as hierarchy, legibility, etc. are part of it.

Tablets and iPhones tend to be more similar to the printed page. The web is the loosest of them all…. Fully systematic. Must be described with rules.

Tools. Thinking natively
