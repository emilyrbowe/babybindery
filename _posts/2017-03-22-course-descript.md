The theories that penned American democracy hardly hold up alongside the fast-moving networks of today. The network connects individuals and groups more easily than neighbors. Who is your neighbor?




 The Web, a synthesis of free software and an open network, offers much to the graphic designer. For the aesthete, the modern browser supports sophisticated renderings that rival printed output. For the technically driven designer, the Web connects frameworks, libraries and communities together into multi-authored and fleeting hives of activity.

Is software making the world a better place? Or is it simply remaking the world – a peaceful means of transferring power and capital from 20th century corporations to 21st century ones? If the digital space is primary, then who is tending to the systems of self-government, defined so articulately in the age of Enlightenment? What is the 21st century social contract?

This course asks students to work together to design tools that further the public interest in the digital space. Where do we locate Rousseau's "general will" in a fractured media landscape. Can the Web embolden citizens to make their cities and states a better place? Might the Internet age advance the ideals of self-government? This course asks students to work together to address these questions. How can screens be used to better off-screen life? Can design reinvigorate an investment in public space, in the public good? What is of common interest?

Students will tackle a series of design problems from the standpoint of the public – creating tools for public enrichment. Assignments will range from voter registration, to voter turnout to infrastructure fundraising to information dissemination. Outside collaborators and readings will enrich the conversation. No previous web experience required, but Web Programming workshop strongly encouraged.
