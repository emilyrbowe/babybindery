The theories that penned American democracy hardly hold up alongside the fast-moving networks of today. The network connects individuals and groups more easily than neighbors. Who is your neighbor?




 The Web, a synthesis of free software and an open network, offers much to the graphic designer. For the aesthete, the modern browser supports sophisticated renderings that rival printed output. For the technically driven designer, the Web connects frameworks, libraries and communities together into multi-authored and fleeting hives of activity.

Is software making the world a better place? Or is it simply remaking the world – peacefully transferring capital from 20th century corporations to 21st century ones? If the digital space is becoming primary, then who is tending to the systems of self-government, defined so articulately in the age of Enlightenment? What is the 21st century social contract?

This Web research elective asks students to design tools that further the public's interest within the digital space. Where do we locate Rousseau's "general will" in this fractured media terrain? Shouldn't the Web better our systems of democracy as much as it has bettered finding a used car? How can screens be used to better the real lives of real people on real planets? Can design reinvigorate an investment in public space, in the public good? Students will work together to engage politicians, non-profits and fellow citizens in the pursuit of these questions.

Students will tackle a series of assignments that range from digital tools to increase voter registration and turnout to civic fundraising to information dissemination. Class deliverables will be a combination of prototypes, presentations and coded mini-sites. Students will develop final projects in teams. Outside collaborators and readings will enrich the conversation and the work. No previous web experience required, but Web Programming workshop strongly encouraged.
