The theories that penned American democracy hardly hold up alongside the fast-moving networks of today. The network connects individuals and groups more easily than neighbors. Who is your neighbor?

 The Web, a synthesis of free software and an open network, offers much to the graphic designer. For the aesthete, the modern browser supports sophisticated renderings that rival printed output. For the technically driven designer, the Web connects frameworks, libraries and communities together into multi-authored and fleeting hives of activity.

Is the Internet making the world a better place or is it simply remaking the world – peacefully transferring capital from 20th century corporations to 21st century ones? If the digital space is becoming primary, then who is tending to the systems of self-government, defined so articulately in the age of Enlightenment?

This Web research elective asks students to design tools that further the public's interest online. Can the Web – designed as an open and free medium – reinvigorate our investment in public space and the public good? Students will work together to engage politicians, non-profits, and fellow citizens in the pursuit of these questions.

Assignments will range from Web tools that serve democracy to civic fundraising to information dissemination. Class deliverables will be a combination of prototypes, presentations and coded mini-sites. Students will develop the parameters for the final project and work in teams. Outside collaborators and readings will enrich the conversation and the work. No previous web experience required, but Web Programming workshop strongly encouraged.
