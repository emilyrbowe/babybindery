First, we’re assuming you are running Jekyll to power your site. 

Download this repo, firstly. Then, bring:<br />
- print.html and print_twocol.html layouts into your _layouts directory. <br />
- any other layout templates you want into your _layouts directory. <br />
- checkboxes_links.js, ** into a folder “js” in your Jekyll base directory. <br />
- book.css, print.css, and two-col.css into your “css” folder. <br />
- book_css.html, checkboxes_links.html, *** into your _includes directory. <br />
- Our _config.yml has three properties at the end: page_width, page_height, and content_types—copy these into your config file. See post “How Do I Change The Content Types”! <br />
