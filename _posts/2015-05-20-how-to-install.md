First, we’re assuming you are running Jekyll to power your site. 

Download this repo, firstly. Then, bring:
- print.html and print_twocol.html layouts into your _layouts directory.
- any other layout templates you want into your _layouts directory. 
- checkboxes_links.js, **** into a folder “js” in your Jekyll base directory.
- book.css, print.css, and two-col.css into your “css” folder. 
- book_css.html, checkboxes_links.html, *** into your _includes directory. 
- Our _config.yml has three properties at the end: page_width, page_height, and content_types—bring these into your config file.
