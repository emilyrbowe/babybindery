LW: Can you tell the story of how you started getting involved in Prince Lab and how it became the BDW? 

CB: I guess there are a couple of strands to this. First of all, when I came back from being in administration, I started teaching ENGN30 which is our introduction to engineering and we had a small design component in it, but I really wanted to build up the amount of design that was in it and have a place in which we could do it and that happened to coincide with the plan that dean Larry Larson had to really take apart Prince Lab and make it into a design space, that kind of wasn’t called “Brown Design Workshop” but he and Chris had talked—to be fair it was really Chris’ idea to do this but Larry was very supportive of it. So they began to work on it and I think largely because of my interest in ENGN3 and the fact that Chris and I have worked together on all kinds of projects, I just kind of, by osmosis got into this whole thing, so that was in the Fall of, I guess it would be, two years ago, or three years ago,

LW: Fall 2013?

CB: Fall 2013 that I really began to set it on all this and then Chris and I spent a lot of time that year talking about how to build design into ENGN30 and came up with the idea of having the undergraduate Mentors and having the projects and so on, really building on from there. 

LW: So those open-ended kinds of student projects? 

CB: Yeah. There was a lot of decisions that had to be made about exactly what this would be, how it would be done, the use of monitors, when it would be open, how it would be for the whole campus, what was feasible, and so on. But it’s really gone well, I think, a huge addition to Brown to have it here.

LW: What experiences were you coming off of that made you say, “we need this to be a part of ENGN30?”

CB: There were several… first of all, to back up with my own history, the last year I was in administration, I was one of the 5 faculty members teaching ENGN30 and it was the first time I’d taught in, I guess, six years at that point, and so I came back into it and I’d always felt like we needed a lot more hands-on components in Engineering our courses were like all courses in the United States at least, very lecture-based, very problem-set based, and I knew from my own experience that while it’s important to do that, and get that straight, that I’d just enjoyed hands-on types of things. Lab work is not necessarily design work but, I always that that was important. A way to really get the students engaged in things they’d find interesting from the very beginning rather than just saying “here’s a book and do these problems and you’ll learn something”—which they will but it could be a lot more than that. The second thing is that I was—I’m a materials engineer by training, mostly metals, and had worked most of my career in pretty much mechanical properties of materials, one way or another, and then I stopped doing my own research when I went into administration, when I came back I really was interested in design, I thought, OK, I can kinda do this at this point, it’s not something—I’m moving on in my career, something I really wanted to think about and I knew Chris was interested in it and I really liked to see it develop as an integral part of engineering. That was a part, and the other thing I realized, this came later, but the students that we’re getting in engineering now, unlike my generation, are really interested in Design, they coming into Engineering  because they want to do design and I think we need to pick up on that and say, OK, we will do design and we will help you do design and we will make that part of your engineering education here. It was all of those that got me engaged in this. 

OK! Do you have any theories as to why this generation is more interested in that kind of work? 

I can take guesses… I know from my own generation, and I’ve heard other people say it, the space program was a big impact for us, we were in high school, or I was in high school, when the first orbital missions even took place and there was this sense of this great program, in being an engineer, was really critical, it was more “science”-ey in its view and so there was more of a sense of the wanting to do the problem sets and that sort of thing. I have a feeling its things like Apple and products we have today that people see “Design” as something that’s part of engineering, but it’s very exciting and there’s an aesthetic part of this as well that triggers interest in it. They see that as very creative and something they want to do. Those are my guesses. I don’t know if that’s correct or not. 

I’d put money on that. And how, in your day-to-day, aside form teaching ENGN30, how do you advocate for the BDW, or work with it as a space?

I think there’s ENGN3 which we do every fall, and Chris and Barret Hazeltine and I have been running an independent study on designing fish cages for use in Lake Victoria, and we meet in this room in the BDW once a week and students work in that area. Every friday we come here at 4:30

I had no idea!

It’s a project that Chris actually first made the contact with this university in Kenya, it’s brand new, and they’re trying to set up programs and Barrett and I were there just a little over a year ago, January 2015, and so we’re trying to look for projects we can jointly do. They’re located very near Lake Victoria and what they’d like to do is develop these fish cages to grow tilapia very near the shore which would be income for the farmers and work in that way. What I’m told this caught on big and they’re almost worried about overfishing but there are many design and technical problems that can be optimized like how to feed the fish and design the cage for optimization and so on, so we have that project that goes on. And I just try to encourage students to use this space for different things, y’know, I’d like to see it more involved with other courses in engineering, see a continuous program through the first two years at least of people of people engaged in this space. 

Seeing more engagement in the long-term is something we’ve been talking about quite a bit.

And also this year I co-teach a course in materials and archeology and this week they cast replicas of real artifacts, but we had them use the 3D printer and solid works to make the molds. So we got that class in here using the 3D printers and seeing what’s in the workshop. the more we can do that—the workshops I hear about on the weekends, the makeathon and so on… 

And more students from across campus, too, that then see this engineering process, here. there’s a lot of that. That was the short list of questions… although I… I’d actually be curious in learning more about how you and Chris—I know that you’ve known each other for a while!

We’ve known each other for 21 years, through Brown! So I came in here, Chris, he’s always been in this office. He was more engaged at that point with the mechanical testing. There was a higher level of research activity using our mechanical testing equipment and a lot of his work at that point was engaged in that. During that time Chris got his Ph.D and I actually was his official Thesis Advisor, although I didn’t advice Chris, he knew what he wanted to do and I tried to help make it possible for him. We just hit it off really well and sort of became really good friends. When I came back to Engineering I really wanted to be engaged with the kinds of things he does because I really like his teaching method, it’s a different method, it’s not the lecture method, but it’s much more, puts your decision, a designed teaching I would say, and I think it’s really good to be exposed to that as part of what you have to learn and deal with so I’ve learned a lot from him about design and about how to run a design-type course as opposed to going up there and lecturing.

And what are some of the key differences between those types of classrooms?

First of all in our lecture classes it’s just information transfer. At best [laughs]. And also, the problems are very much, there’s an answer you’re trying to get at. I was in industry for a long time and it’s never that simple. You’re always making trade-offs and making decisions and well, if we do this, and this, well… it’ll cost less and you don’t be done or vice versa and thinking about all the constraints—I spent 7 years at GE revamping this factory, where they make, actually, the filaments for incandescent light bulbs, and there’s a lot to do in that factory and I learned a huge amount doing that, and for example you’re not trying to make _the very best possible_ filament, you’re trying to make that filament that will go in a light bulb that will cost you 98 cents, so you’ve gotta manage all of this in some way that’s rarely taught but I think in design even if it’s a fairly simple project, you do get this idea, well, there are a number of solution and which one is the better of those, or the best, but not necessarily perfect, and what makes it that way and how will I get to that, and who do I…? and I think, also, one idea I’ve thought is going to other people for help. The fish cage, you need to know something about, say, protein in fish food and go find someone an talk to them! with a lecture, problem sets you don’t say “go find an expert and let them tell you how to solve this problem” but in reality that kind of thing happens a lot, I think. So there’s a lot of other ways of solving problems that come about in design that we just don’t get to in a typical classroom setting. 

That’s definitely why I’m an advocate as well.
