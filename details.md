Content areas in print template that should appear onscreen as well:
- Halftitle
- Title page
- TOC
- Multiple templates for content types (interview, image only)
- Basic basic CSS (one size helvetica)
- Print size letter, but should ideally use relative units if changed (ideally one size needs to change and columns adjust (90w)
- Cover not needed now… can use TOC/Title, etc.
- Sort by date edited? By category?
- Folio and footnote stuff (right, Lukas)

- No bleed marks and show bleeds


Basically the folders in Jekyll with Markdown type experience

FUTURE::::
- Index in future
- Select stories in future
- Sorting as part of selection process

v 0.0:
Bindery will take two different print layouts from two Jekyll layouts and generate a book from all existing pages. We’ll use dummy content. The print layout will be fixed. One layout will be with blogs in mind, the other for gallery content (PCG). 

v 1.0:
Bindery will allow you to select which pages to include in the book, filtering by content types. Maybe increased flexibility in layouts.

v 2.0 … ?
Greater flexibility & extensibility
